    <section id="about">
        <h2>About LLP</h2>
        <p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a unique type of business setup that combines features of both partnerships and companies. In an LLP, partners enjoy limited liability, similar to shareholders in a company, while also benefiting from the flexibility and simplicity of a partnership.</p>
        <p>LLPs have become popular among entrepreneurs in various industries because they shield partners' assets and have more straightforward regulatory requirements than traditional corporations. The concept of LLP was introduced in India in 2008 and is governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, offering a dependable and adaptable option for businesses of all sizes.</p>

    <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages of LLP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Own Legal Identity:</strong> An LLP is like its own person, just like big companies. This helps people trust and work with it, as it can do legal things independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Less Risk for Partners:</strong> LLP partners are only responsible for what they put in. They don't have to pay for all the debts or losses, which is good for their reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Saves Money and Time:</strong> Starting an LLP costs less and has fewer rules than big companies. There's less paperwork to do every year.</li>
            <li><strong>No Fixed Money Needed:</strong> You don't need much money to start an LLP. Partners can put in whatever amount they want.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="disadvantages">
        <h2>Disadvantages of LLP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Getting in Trouble for Not Following Rules:</strong> Even though LLPs have fewer rules, they can get big fines if they don't follow them on time. Even if an LLP doesn't do anything in a year, it still needs to tell the government or get fined.</li>
            <li><strong>Ending an LLP:</strong> An LLP needs at least two partners. It must stop if it has fewer than two partners for six months. Also, it might have to close if it can't pay its debts.</li>
            <li><strong>Hard to Get Big Money:</strong> LLPs don't work like big companies where people invest money and become owners. This makes it tricky to get a lot of money from investors.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="name-structure">
        <h2>LLP Name Structure</h2>
        <p>Choose a unique name that is not used by other businesses. This makes approval easier and establishes your identity. Include words that clearly describe what your business does. This helps people understand your services or products.</p>
        <p>End your LLP name with "LLP" or "Limited Liability Partnership." This is necessary to show your business structure.</p>

    <section id="procedure">
        <h2>Procedure for LLP Registration</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Obtain a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC):</strong> All proposed partners of the LLP must obtain a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) since all government filings require digital signatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Obtain Director Identification Number (DIN):</strong> Partners without a DIN need to apply for one. The Director Identification Number (DIN) is a unique identification number assigned to individuals aspiring to become directors or designated partners in LLPs.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose a Name for the LLP:</strong> Select a unique and suitable name for your LLP, adhering to Ministry of Corporate Affairs guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Form for Incorporation of LLP (FiLLiP):</strong> This form collects essential information about the proposed LLP, partners, LLP agreement, and registered office address. It includes a declaration from partners consenting to act as designated partners and comply with LLP regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft LLP Agreement:</strong> Create the LLP Agreement outlining partner rights, duties, and obligations. This agreement must be notarized and filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs within 30 days of incorporation.</li>
            <li><strong>Obtain a Certificate of Incorporation:</strong> Once forms and documents are filed and verified, the Registrar of Companies (RoC) will issue the Certificate of Incorporation, officially recognizing the LLP's existence.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply for PAN and TAN:</strong> After obtaining the Certificate of Incorporation, apply for the Permanent Account Number (PAN) and TAN for the LLP.</li>
        </ol>
